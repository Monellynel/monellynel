## About me 


💻 software developer

🩶 i'm fond of many languages, but c++ will always be my first love

⌨️ favorite platform to write code: MS Word first-- i know, brutal-- then, repl.it
🤸🏻 The best way i squash bugs in my codes: pilates, solidcore, barre.. and if all else fails, a good nights sleep
💬 I’m looking to collaborate on new app developement ideas and like-minded devs
🧐 I’m looking for help with getting more exposure as a young dev, especially in healthcare programs
